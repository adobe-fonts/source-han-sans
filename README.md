# Downloading Source Han Sans

Source Han Sans is an open source Pan-CJK typeface whose OpenType/CFF fonts and CID-based sources are covered under the terms of the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL) (also see the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) and [FAQ](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL-FAQ_web)). Here you will find the ready-to-install OpenType/CFF font resources, as individual font resources or grouped together in downloadable ZIP files. The fonts' CID-based sources and build instructions are available in the [repository's `master` branch](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/). Those who are unfamiliar with GitHub are encouraged to reference the [official Source Han download guide](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/raw/release/download-guide-source-han.pdf), which is provided in English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

### Super OTC

Select this deployment format if you want all five languages and all seven weights, along with the half-width (HW) variations that are provided only for the Regular and Bold weights, in a single and easy-to-manage font resource that includes 45 fonts. Changing languages is accomplished by either selecting the font of the desired language or by language-tagging the text. A limited number of apps support language tagging and the corresponding OpenType 'locl' (*Localized Forms*) GSUB feature, such as [Adobe InDesign CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html) and modern browsers.

[Latest Release](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/releases/latest/) or [Super OTC](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/raw/release/SuperOTC/SourceHanSans.ttc.zip)

**Special Note**: This deployment format requires macOS (OS X) Version 10.8 (aka *Mountain Lion*) or later, iOS 7 or later, Windows 10 Version 1703 (aka *Creators Update*) or later, a flavor of Linux that uses *fontconfig* and FreeType Version 2.5.0.1 or greater, or Adobe CS6 apps or later.

### OTCs

Select this deployment format if you want all five languages and particular weights, or if your environment does not support the Super OTC. Changing languages is accomplished the same way as the Super OTC. If you need particular weights, download individual font resources from the [OTC](OTC) folder, otherwise click both of the links below:

[ExtraLight + Light + Normal + Regular](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/raw/release/OTC/SourceHanSansOTC_EL-R.zip) & [Medium + Bold + Heavy](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/raw/release/OTC/SourceHanSansOTC_M-H.zip)

**Note**: The Regular and Bold weights include 10 fonts due to the addition of the half-width (HW) variations.

**Special Note**: This deployment format requires macOS (OS X) Version 10.8 (aka *Mountain Lion*) or later, iOS 7 or later, Windows 10 Version 1607 (aka *Anniversary Update*) or later, a flavor of Linux that uses *fontconfig* and FreeType Version 2.5.0.1 or greater, or Adobe CS6 apps or later.

### Language-specific OTFs

Select this deployment format if you prefer to use only one language, but also want full character coverage or the ability to language-tag text to use glyphs that are appropriate for the other languages (like the Super OTC and OTCs, this requires an app that supports language tagging and the OpenType 'locl' GSUB feature). Font resources that include "HW" in their names use half-width glyphs for ASCII by default. If you need only specific weights, download individual font resources from the [OTF](OTF) folder, otherwise click on the appropriate links below:
